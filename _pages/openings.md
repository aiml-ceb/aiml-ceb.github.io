<div style="text-align: justify">We invite researchers working on topics such as predictive modelling of biological function and properties, generative and simulation-based approaches, adaptive experimental design, data integration, and other emerging areas to join this vibrant exchange on shaping the next generation of AI-enabled biological discovery.

# Call for Papers 

<div style="text-align: justify">We welcome extended abstracts (2-4 pages, non-archival), including works-in-progress and preliminary results. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Prediction of biomolecular structures, properties, complexes, and interactions
* Generative models for biological sequences and structures
* Bayesian optimization and active learning for guided biological experimentation
* Geometric and symmetry-aware deep learning for molecular representations
* Interpretable and uncertainty-aware models for biological design
* Multi-modal learning over sequence, structure, and functional data
* Benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation protocols for biological design tasks
* Foundation models for biology
* Novel applications of AI in computational and experimental biology
* Position papers and/or posters addressing fundamental challenges or limitations of AI in computational and experimental biology

<div style="text-align: justify">Accepted submissions will be presented posters, with a select few being chosen as short spotlight talks, and will be made available on the workshop website. This is a non-archival workshop, allowing authors to publish full versions of their work at future venues.
